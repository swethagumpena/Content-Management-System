### Problem statement:

A Content Management System(CMS) is an application used to manage different types of web content allowing multiple contributors to create, edit and publish. Content in a CMS is typically stored in a database and displayed in a presentation layer based on a set of templates.

The following are the basic features of a CMS:

- Content creation (allows users to easily create and format content)
- Content storage (stores content in one place, in a consistent fashion)
- Workflow management (assigns privileges and responsibilities based on roles such as authors, editors and admins)
- Publishing (organizes and pushes content live)

### Features:

- Register and login for user (using auth-service)
- All subsequent API calls from the front-end are authenticated (using auth-service)
- Create a content type and dynamically update it
- Create data for a given content type
- Get all data of a given content type
